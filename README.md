# NumPy Operations and Examples

This repository contains various examples and operations performed using NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computations in Python. The examples cover a wide range of array manipulations, mathematical operations, and advanced features such as linear algebra, random number generation, and more.

## Features

- **Array Creation and Manipulation**: Demonstrates how to create and manipulate NumPy arrays (e.g., creating arrays with `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, and `np.arange()`).
- **Array Indexing and Slicing**: Includes examples of how to index and slice arrays efficiently.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Illustrates operations like element-wise arithmetic, broadcasting, and vectorization for faster computations.
- **Linear Algebra**: Solves systems of equations, computes eigenvalues, and performs matrix multiplication and decomposition.
- **Statistical Operations**: Calculates statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and more.
- **Random Number Generation**: Explores random number generation and Monte Carlo simulations.
- **Data Aggregation**: Uses aggregation functions like `np.sum()`, `np.min()`, and `np.max()` to process data.
- **Matrix Operations**: Includes matrix transposition, reshaping, and splitting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

You can install NumPy using pip if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
